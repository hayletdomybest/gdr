# GoModRename

GoModRename is a command-line tool designed to simplify the process of renaming Go modules. It automatically updates the module name in the `go.mod` file and adjusts all import paths in the project's Go files.

## Installation

To install GoModRename, use the following command:

```
go install github.com/hayletdomybest/grd@v0.1.0-alpha
```

Ensure that your Go bin directory is in your system's PATH.

## Usage

```
grd rename [new_name] -p  [project_path]
```

- `new_name`: The new module name you want to use
- `project_path`: (Optional) The path to your Go project. If not provided, the current directory will be used.
